                <p>Users today are less patient with performance and poor design in newer apps than they were 10 years ago. Load times longer than 2 seconds or even poorly designed logos can cause new users to drop off quickly.</p>
                <p>Early-stage apps who may not have the time to fully optimize performance just yet can rely on animation to enhance perceived performance. Studies have shown that visual feedback during wait times can make the wait feel shorter.</p>
                <p>The splash screen crafts a luxurious first impression that fortifies the brand identity and the loading screen improves the perceived responsiveness of the app.</p>
                <p>I played with Beziers to make the animation feel as though the 2 divers in the logo are genuinely taking a leap.</p>

                <p>Good onboarding teaches users but great onboarding creates habits. A great onboarding experience that effectively relays to users how a product can be valuable to them—to the point where they keep coming back to use it—is key to growth & retention.</p>
                <p>While leading the design for user onboarding, I learned 3 main takeaways:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>The best onboarding designs comes from video games. Kill the tooltips and carousels and encourage exploration. Users best learn by doing, not being shown instructions. Use visual hints to pique feature curiosity. If you are using text, make them as contextual as possible. Don’t teach everything all at once at the beginning, sprinkle explanations throughout all parts of the new user flow as users try the product.</li>
                    <li>Take users to the value proposition quickly, but elements of friction can be useful as well. Intentional friction can sometimes get users to understand the product value better.</li>
                    <li>Reach out to your dormant users! Figure out why and where they churn. Digging deep into the funnel data and seeing which step they fall off is invaluable information.</li>
                </ol>

                <p>Marine Snow was conceived with the vision of feeling like a video game. The experience was designed to be sophisticated, but playful.</p>
                <p>Songs come in the form of orbs. Orbs are made up of shards. Users can earn shards by being active participants of the community.</p>
                <p>Akin to how fashion & streetwear brands build hype around their apparel drops, songs similarly drop in Marine Snow in Capsule units. Capsules contain 2-3 songs, drop every few weeks, and are fleeting to build a sense of urgency.</p>
                <p>Songs on Marine Snow are exclusive to the platform and are only available for 90 days after their release.</p>

                <p>Social feeds these days display a lot of user activity, and we are sometimes drawn to the noise or turn a deaf ear to it entirely.</p>
                <p>The Notifications tab, which was similar in form to Instagram’s Notifications feed, evolved into a tab called Ecosystem. This new tab attempted to split social activity into the peripheral and the pertinent.</p>
                <p>At the top, a horizontal auto-scrolling marquee displays other user’s activities (e.g. what other users just listened to, what songs they collected). Users have the option to explore through this peripheral activity, rabbit-hole, and discover new users.</p>
                <p>Because it takes up little real estate, they can also quickly disregard this marquee and simply scroll down to the more relevant activities that pertain to them (e.g. other users replying to their posts or DMing them).</p>
                <p>We were primarily inspired by stock apps who use similar marquees to display ephemeral, fleeting financial data.</p>
                <p>Launching the Ecosystem significantly boosted social activity within the app.</p>

                <p>As of 2023, not one music platform has truly perfected the social aspect of the music listening experience yet. The place to discuss about music and the place to listen to music are often  in separate environments. YouTube comments are one of the few bastions where this exists, but its social aspects are still surface-level at best.</p>
                <p>Groups was a feature we pushed to encompass the best parts of online music communities and the streaming experience. Users could create groups about genres or artists, collectively curate media, and dive deep in conversations with other music lovers.</p>
